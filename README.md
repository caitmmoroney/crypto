This project utilizes the [Coinbase Pro API](https://docs.pro.coinbase.com/) to access public market information (e.g., ETH-USD market price) as well as Coinbase Pro user account information. If you have a Coinbase Pro API key, you can run this code once you have saved your API key, secret key, passphrase, and API url (https://api.pro.coinbase.com/) as environment variables.
